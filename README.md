## Description:
  This application will have the ability to allow a user to input a medical issue or a Doctor's name and having information provided to them via a search function that will provide information such as : first name, last name, address, phone number, website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patient, as further described below in detail in the "Specs" section.

Specs:
*  A user will be able to enter a medical issue to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.

*  A user will be able to enter a name to receive a list of doctors in the Portland area that fit the search query.

* If the query response includes any doctors, the following information should be included about each doctor: first name, last name, address, phone number,   website and whether or not the doctor is accepting new patients (the API provides this data).

* If the API call results in an error (any message not a 200 OK), the application should return a notification that states what the error is.

* If the query response doesn't include any doctors (for instance, if no doctors meet the search criteria), the application should return a notification that states that no doctors meet the criteria. (This is not an error so it should be handled separately from any errors.)

## Setup/Installation Requirements
* Clone or download Git files provided.
* Open with desired Text editor (I used Atom).
* Set-up your own repositories, and branches to edit and add as needed.
* Node.JS will be needed to utilize testing environment used for TDD process.
* Webpack, and associated .JSON file have required dependencies.
* "npm run install" will acquire needed packages and plugin associated with project.
